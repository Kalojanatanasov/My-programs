//Problem 5 – Three in One
//Solving one task is too mainstream. Solving two task is also too mainstream.
//You are given three tasks. Solve them all.
//First task
//A round of Blackjack has ended and it's time to reveal the winner. Use the following two rules to determine the outcome of the round:
//•  If a player has more than 21 points, he loses.
//•	Of all the players who have 21 or fewer points, the ones with the maximum number of points are the winners.
//You are given a zero-based list of integers called points, where points[i] is the number of points received by the i-th player.
//If there is exactly one winner, your program should print the 0-based index of the winning player. Otherwise, it should print -1.
//Second task
//You have a birthday party with your friends! On the table are a variety of cakes of different sizes, with size being measured in "bites". You've decided to take turns picking cakes until all of the cakes are picked by either you or one of your friends. You all like big cakes, so each person on their turn will pick the biggest remaining cake. If there's a tie for the biggest cake, it doesn't matter which of the tied cakes is picked. Since it's your birthday, you get to pick the first cake.
//For example, suppose you have 2 friends and there are 5 cakes with sizes of 6, 7, 9, 6, and 4. You will pick the 9 bite cake, your first friend will pick the 7 bite cake, your other friend will get one of the 6 bite cakes, you will get the other 6 cake, and your 1st friend will get the 4. You will get a total of 15 bites.
//F will be the number of friends you have with you (not including you). sizes will be a list of integers, each of which is the size of one cake - not necessarily in order of size.
//Your program should find the total bites of cake you will get.
//Third task
//Your character in an RPG game has G1 gold, S1 silver and B1 bronze coins. You need G2 gold, S2 silver and B2 bronze coins to buy a new beer. A bank in the game supports four types of exchange operations:
//•	the bank will give you 9 silver coins in exchange for 1 gold coin
//•	the bank will give you 1 gold coin in exchange for 11 silver coins
//•	the bank will give you 9 bronze coins in exchange for 1 silver coin
//•	the bank will give you 1 silver coin in exchange for 11 bronze coins
//Find the minimal number of exchange operations required for your character to hold at least G2 gold, at least S2 silver and at least B2 bronze coins. Print -1 if the character doesn’t have enough money for beer.
//Input
//The input data should be read from the console.
//The elements of the points list are given on the first input line, separated by a single comma.
//The elements of the sizes list will be given on the second input line, separated by a single comma. The number F will be given on the third input line.
//Numbers G1, S1, B1, G2, S2 and B2 will be given on the fourth input line separated by a single space.
//The input data will always be valid and in the format described. There is no need to check it explicitly.
//Output
//The output data should be printed on the console.
//On the first output line print the solution of the first task (the index of the Blackjack winner).
//On the second output line print the solution of the second task (the total bites of cake you will get).
//On the third output line print the solution of the third task (minimal number of exchange operations).
//Constraints
//•	points will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive. Each element of points will be between 1 and 35, inclusive.
//•	sizes will contain between 1 and 10 elements, inclusive. Each element of sizes will be between 1 and 10, inclusive. F will be between 1 and 5, inclusive.
//•	G1, S1, B1, G2, S2 and B2 will each be between 0 and 1 000 000, inclusive.
//•	Allowed working time for your program: 0.2 seconds. Allowed memory: 16 MB.
